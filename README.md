# DecentScraper
A webscraper starter for anyone who wants to use it.

This scraper takes a URL and class to scrape (ids, elements, and more will come later -- feel free to add them!),
then returns the count of results, a printout of the results, and an options menu that allows you to exit or export the results to a .txt or .csv file.

Right now, the .txt and .csv save to the current working directory. I may add some filesystem options to work around that in future iterations.

## Further Options

This also tells a joke that Ronald Reagan claims was popular in the USSR and have a recursive Fibonacci sequence for your entertainment.
These are purely features to keep you entertained while you're working on this project.

## Usage

Use this however you want, wherever you want. My hope is that it will get into the hands of new developers who can tailor it to their very-early-career freelancing needs.

## Credit/Citations

Feel free to credit me if you use this or share it, but I'm wayyyy too lazy to pursue you if you don't (also I don't care), so no pressure.

## Other Soviet Jokes?

Yes, I know plenty. I won't work them into this just yet, but maybe I'll randomize a few in the future?
